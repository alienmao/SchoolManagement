            Swiper
            Swiper - is the free and most modern mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Designed mostly for iOS, but also works great on latest Android, Windows Phone 8 and modern Desktop browsers

            Swiper is not compatible with all platforms, it is a modern touch slider which is focused only on modern apps/platforms to bring the best experience and simplicity.

            Swiper, along with other great components, is a part of Framework7 - full featured framework for building iOS & Android apps. Swiper is also a default slider component in Ionic Framework

            Powered With Top Notch Features
            Library Agnostic
            Swiper doesn't require any JavaScript libraries like jQuery, it makes Swiper much more smaller and faster. So it can be safety to use it with such libraries as jQuery, Zepto, jQuery Mobile, etc.

            1:1 Touch movement
            By defaut Swiper provides 1:1 touch movement interraction, but this ratio could be configured through Swiper settings

            Mutation Observer
            Swiper has option to enable Mutation Observer, with this feature Swiper will be automatically reinitilized and recalculate all required parameters if you make dynamic changes in DOM, or in Swiper styles itself

            Reach API
            Swiper comes with very rich API. It allows to create your own pagination, navigation buttons, create parallax effects and many more

            Full True RTL Support
            Swiper is the only slider that provides 100% RTL support with correct layout

            Multi Row Slides Layout
            Swiper allows to have multiple row slides layout, with few slides per column

            Transition Effects
            There are 3 new transition effects in addition to ususal Slide: Fade, 3D Cube and 3D Coverflow

            Two-way Control
            Now Swiper may be used as controller for any number of other Swipers, and even be controlled at the same time

            Full Navigation Control
            Swiper comes with all required built-in navigation elements, such are Pagination, Navigation arrows and Scrollbar

            Flexbox Layout
            Swiper uses modern flexbox layout for slides layout, this solves a lot of problems and time with size caclulations. Such layout also allows to configure Slides grid using pure CSS

            Most Flexible Slides Layout Grid
            Swiper has a lot of parameters on initialization to make it as much flexible as possible. You can control slides per view, per column, per group, space between slides, and many more

            Parallax Transitions
            Swiper supports modern parallax transition effects that can be used on any element inside of Swiper: on images, on text blocks, on headings, on backgrounds, etc.

            Images Lazy Loading
            Swiper Lazy Loading delays loading of images in none active/visible slides until user swipes to them. Such feature could make the page load faster and improve Swiper performance

            Virtual Slides
            Swiper 4 comes with new Virtual Slides features which is great when you have a lot of slides or heavy-content (or heavy-images) slides so it will keep just required amount of slides in DOM

            And many more ...
            All Swiper 2 well-known features are also here: Responsive, Scroll prevention, Resistant bounds, Autoplay, Loop mode, Nested Swipers
